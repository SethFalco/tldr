# resume

> CLI tool to easily setup a new resume.
> More information: <https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli>.

- Create a new `resume.json` file in your current working directory:

`resume init`

- Validate your `resume.json` against our schema tests to ensure it complies with the standard:

`resume validate`

- Export your resume locally in a stylized HTML or PDF format:

`resume export {{path/to/output}}`

- Start a web server that serves your local `resume.json`:

`resume serve`
